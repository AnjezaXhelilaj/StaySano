For my mobile programming project, I have developed an application named StaySano. The name combines the English word “Stay” with “Sano”, which is Latin for “healthy”, reflecting the app's core purpose: Stay Healthy.

StaySano is designed to digitalize healthcare services, allowing users to access essential medical resources directly from the comfort of their homes.
The app eliminates the need to physically visit hospitals or clinics for basic tasks like booking appointments, ordering lab tests, or purchasing medicines. 
In addition, it promotes health awareness by providing access to a curated selection of health-related articles and the latest updates in the medical field.

Key Functionalities:
Login – Secure user authentication.

Registration – New user sign-up process.

Lab Test – View multiple test package details, add them to a cart, and place orders.

Medicine – Browse the medicine list, add items to a cart, and place orders.

Find Doctor – Search for specialist doctors and book appointments.

Health Articles – Read informative articles to stay updated on health topics.

Order Details – View information on placed orders.

Logout – End user session securely.

Technical Implementation:
The technologies used to build this project are JAVA, and MySQL. 
All user and order information is stored in an SQL database, ensuring reliable and structured data management.
